- Visit [iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/](https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/).
- Enter your email address and a password, and click “Create account”.
- On the next page, scroll down to choose the Start (free) plan.
- Once you’ve confirmed your account via a confirmation email, sign in to [iexcloud.io](https://iexcloud.io/).
- Click API Tokens.
- Copy the key that appears under the Token column (it should begin with `pk_`).
